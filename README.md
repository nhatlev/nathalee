üåç **Aspiring Planetary Physicist || Tech Enthusiast**

### About Me
I have a fascination for the planetary formation and evolution processes and matter interaction in strange conditions. My research interests focus on:
- **Planetary interior and surface physical and thermal modeling** üåã
- **Astrobiology, life-building blocks** üåå
- **Icy moons** ‚ùÑÔ∏è

I have had the opportunity to work on projects related to Earth's atmosphere/climate modeling (USTH Bachelor), lunar surface roughness (Intership 2023), Martian elements distributions, thermal evolution of planets and moons, gravity and magnetic modeling, all of these are acquired from my master courseworks. 

I am currently interested in physical chemistry, which focus on interaction at atomic and molecule-scale of matter, in order to study the potential organic can form and transform on planetary bodies, on both surface and inferior.

### Technical Skills
I've built essential skills during my coursework and internship, including:
- **Computational Physics Programming** in Python, MATLAB, with and without Generative AI, applying numerical methods to solve physical problems and visualize the physical processes/models. 
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Mostly using Python NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, with statistical-based calculation.
- **Machine Learning Application:** Using scikit-learn, knowing basic steps to train, test and predict with given dataset, mainly with prediction for Earth weather/ Space matters. 
- **Signal and Image Processing**: IDL, MATLAB, Python, convolution, Fourier transform, wavelets transform, filters.

I am continue to learn and sharpen and broadedn my technical competances. It would be helpful to contribute the most I can in Space Physics, Extraterrestrial Chemistry/Biology.
